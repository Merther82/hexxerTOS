2. Information We Collect
Hexxer is designed to respect user privacy and collect only the minimal data necessary for its functionality. We do not collect, store, or share personal information. Here’s what we access and process:
•	User Commands: When you send commands to Hexxer (such as requesting a color change), Hexxer temporarily processes the command in order to execute the requested action. This data is not stored and is discarded after the command is completed.
•	Server and Role Information: Hexxer accesses server settings, role hierarchies, and permissions only to:
o	Assign custom color roles to users as requested,
o	Check Hexxer’s role position in the hierarchy for color display functionality, and
o	Ensure Hexxer operates without conflict with other roles.
•	Server message history in real-time to the applicable range of commands needed for basic function.
________________________________________
3. How We Use Information

Hexxer uses the information it temporarily processes to:
•	Execute user commands for color customization,
•	Generate role colors based on user-provided hex codes,
•	Assign and manage roles within a server to ensure proper functionality of color customization,
•	Verify that Hexxer’s role is positioned correctly in the server hierarchy for color display.
All data accessed or processed by Hexxer is used solely for these operational purposes and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with third parties.

4. Data Retention and Security

•	Temporary Data Processing: Hexxer processes data in real-time and does not store any user data or server information after the command is completed.
•	No Data Storage: Hexxer does not retain any personal data or user commands after processing is complete. Hexxer operates solely in memory and does not create logs of interactions or store any identifiable information about users or servers.
•	Security Practices: Hexxer operates according to Discord’s API guidelines and best practices, ensuring that data is only accessed in a secure and limited manner. Hexxer does not connect to any third-party services or databases, reducing risks related to data storage or transmission.
