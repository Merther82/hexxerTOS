2. Overview of Hexxer Services
Hexxer is a Discord bot that provides role color customization for users. It allows users to:
•	Assign custom colors to themselves via hex color codes.
•	Preview the chosen color before confirming the change.
•	Manage color roles in a way that respects server role hierarchy.
Hexxer’s services are intended solely for the customization of user role colors and are not designed for moderation, music, or other general-purpose bot functionality. 
Hexxer deals with roles based on its own highest role, and not the target user’s.

4. Bot Usage and Responsibilities
•	Server Admin Permissions: Hexxer requires certain permissions to operate properly, such as role management and message interaction permissions. By adding Hexxer to your server, you grant it the permissions necessary for its color customization features to function.
•	Role Management: Hexxer will automatically create and manage color roles as requested by users. Color roles will be placed in the server’s role hierarchy to ensure color visibility on usernames.

5. Limitations of Service
Hexxer is designed solely for color customization purposes. It does not:
•	Provide moderation, music, games, or any features outside role color customization.
•	Offer guarantees of compatibility with all servers, as issues may arise due to permissions, server settings, or Discord API limitations.
•	Offer support for complex role hierarchies or permissions configurations beyond simple role color application, to the discretion of Hexxer’s API. 
________________________________________
6. Data Collection and Privacy
Hexxer does not collect or store personally identifiable information. However, Hexxer may collect and process:
•	User Commands: Hexxer temporarily processes the commands users send to it (such as hex color codes). These commands are not stored or retained beyond the duration of the command processing.
•	Server and Role Data: To assign colors and manage roles, Hexxer requires access to certain server and role data. This data is accessed in real-time and is not stored or shared.
Hexxer complies with Discord’s API guidelines and does not transmit, share, or store any personal information or server data beyond what is required for basic functionality.
